# Bin Your Gum - A Pygame Game

## About The Game
This project is a game called Bin Your Gum. It was created using the pygame module written in python. This game is to encourage people to bin their gum when their done. I was inspired to make a game like this after I saw a informational advertisement on the television. The [advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bdHYHPKCc) encourages people to bin their gum with a catchy slogan, Bin you gum when you're done and avoid a 150 euro fine.
